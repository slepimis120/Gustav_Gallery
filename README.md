# Gustav_Gallery
Gustav Gallery mini project for "Computer Graphics", using OpenGL library, specifically working with 2D graphics.

## Specification
Create a graphic representation of the gallery with the following elements:
On the wall of golden squares there are 3 black frames with paintings by Gustav Klimt (Pictures by Gustav Klimt to load as a texture, the choice of images is up to the student doing the task).
- By pressing '1' on keyboard, each picture should be mirrored (swapped left and right sides) and show only the vertices of the triangles forming the frames.
- By pressing '2' on keyboard, the images are turned upside down (the top side of the image is turned down) and show only the edges of the triangles forming the frames.
- By pressing '3' on keyboard, the images return to normal and the frames are drawn fully. (the size of the dots and lines must be greater than 1 pixel).
- By pressing '4' on keyboard, in the middle of each image appears a circle whose color pulsates over time. Circles are moving simultaneously pressing the WASD key. Circles cannot leave the border of the image.
- By pressing '5' on keyboard, circles disappear.
In one part of the wall, there is the name, last name and index number of the person working on the assignment.
